[Darkness in the Forest (Book 1)](https://adaeris.github.io/DarknessintheForest)

Warrior cats is a book series by Erin Hunter. Currently there are 7 arcs.
1. The Prophecy Begins
2. The New Prophecy
3. The Power of Three
4. Omen of The Stars
5. Dawn of The Clans
6. A Vision of Shadows
7. The Broken Code

There are 6 books in every arc.
And no, I am not going to name every book.
In every book there are 20-30 chapters
There are also manga, feild guids, extra novels, and super editions. (super editions have about 50 chapters ;-;)
(The picture on the top is From The Power Of Three. Book 4 called eclipse)

This is unoffical because I don't own Warriors.



Space, we don't know a lot about it. Though we are learning. It will take many years to figure out what is here in the present, that is nearby
The universe keeps growing. It will take so long, we might never know everything in space. - Leo (The creater of the website nickname)

I can make plenty of OCs for you and maybe with all of them I can make something like my own Warriors books! It will take a while. but tell me your thoughts! click 'My OCs! copy if you want :3' above to read their discriptions I gave them!

I am sorry if Darkness in the Forest is short!
