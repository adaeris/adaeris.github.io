Hi! This is my website just about my opinions on things and other random stuff (I don't know what to write ok?), online I go by Mizu.

A few things I enjoy include: Danganronpa, Happy Sugar Life, Project Sekai: Colorful Stage!, Cookie Run Kingdom, Omori, anime, books, and vocaloid music.

Anime include: 
Sword Art Online, Gun Gale Online, No Game No Life, The Disasterous Life of Saiki K., Noragami, K-On!, Toradora!,and Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun.

Other games I like:
Roblox (Specifically Flicker, 3008, and Dead Silence), Minecraft Dungeons, Honkai Impact 3rd (kind of-not really), and Minecraft (kind of-not really)

Favorite books include:
The Giver Series, Manga, Neil Gaiman (Coraline and The Ocean at the End of the Lane specifically), and Answers in the Pages. 
I am starting to read the Lunar Chronicles and The Hunger Games as well.


This was 100% not last updated like a year ago.
I'll probably start updating this with more info on the things I like.
