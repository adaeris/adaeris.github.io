5. Dawn of The Clans
6. A Vision of Shadows

There are 6 books in every arc.
And no, I am not going to name every book.
In every book there are 20-30 chapters
There are also manga, feild guids, extra novels, and super editions. (super editions have about 40-50 chapters and novellas are 7-10 chapters, talk about short and long ;-;)

This is unoffical because I don't own Warriors.



Space, we don't know a lot about it. Though we are learning. It will take many years to figure out what is here in the present, that is nearby
The universe keeps growing. It will take so long, we might never know everything in space. - Leo (The creater of the website nickname)

I can make plenty of OCs for you and maybe with all of them I can make something like my own Warriors books! It will take a while. but tell me your thoughts! click 'My OCs! copy if you want :3' above to read their discriptions I gave them! I make OCs all the time! In the Wiki, type the discription and i'll try to make it. this only works in Roblox, Warrior cats: Ultimate Edition. Also tell me your Roblox user so we can friend, get into the game, I share the outfit and I leave, then unfriend. That is the process.
