Warrior cats is a book series by Erin Hunter. Currently there are 7 arcs.
1. The Prophecy Begins
2. The New Prophecy
3. The Power of Three
4. Omen of The Stars
5. Dawn of The Clans
6. A Vision of Shadows
7. The Broken Code
8. (COMING SOON!) A Starless Clan

There are 6 books in every arc.
And no, I am not going to name every book.
In every book there are 20-30 chapters
There are also manga, feild guids, extra novels, and super editions. (super editions have about 40-50 chapters and novellas are 7-10 chapters, talk about short and long ;-;)
(The picture on the top is From The Power Of Three. Book 4 called eclipse)

This is unoffical because I don't own Warriors or space (who owns space tho ;-;)
