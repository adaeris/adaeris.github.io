This is my Warrior Cat blog. Here i will talk about a bunch of Warrior Cat stuff (that i know)


December 28th 2020. 
First of all, one of the most recent things that happend with where i am at (i am about halfway through A Dangerous Path and planning to finish it later) RIP Snowkit.

Sigh, I am mad at that hawk....
There was also a fire that destroyed Thunderclan territory. And it all starts to grow back. :D In Leaf-bare. ;-;
I'm going to tell you things that they say in warrior cats instead of other things. like how i used Leaf-bare.

Newleaf=Spring

Greenleaf=Summer

Leaf-fall=Fall/Autumn

Leaf-bare=Winter

Thunderpath=road, street, etc.

Monster=Car

Kittypet=pet cat

Twoleg=human

Twolegplace=home


That is it for now! Stay tuned :D
