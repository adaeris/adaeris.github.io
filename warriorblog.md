This is my Warrior Cat blog. Here i will talk about a bunch of Warrior Cat stuff (that i know)


December 28th 2020. 
First of all, one of the most recent things that happend with where i am at (i am about halfway through A Dangerous Path and planning to finish it later) RIP Snowkit
Sigh, I am mad at that hawk....
There was also a fire that destroyed Thunderclan territory. And it all starts to grow back. :D In Leaf-bare. ;-;
I'm going to tell you things that they say in warrior cats instead of other things. like how i used Leaf-bare.

Newleaf=Spring
Greenleaf=Summer
Leaf-fall=Fall/Autumn
Leaf-bare=Winter
Thunderpath=road, street, etc.
Monster=Car
Kittypet=pet cat
Twoleg=human
Twolegplace=home

That is it for now! Stay tuned :D
