## Chapter 1 (Skykit)

It was a nice sunny day. Skykit went outside of the nursery with Honeykit, her sister. Berrysky, her mother was watching them from the nursery.

"You guys can play mossball." Berrysky requested.

Hmm, maybe we can play. it would be fun. Skykit thought.

"Lets do it!" Honeykit replied exitedly.

"Who should throw first?" Skykit asked.

"What did you say?" Honeykit asked.

Honeykit is mostly deaf. and Skykit hated it.

"WHO SHOULD THROW FIRST?!?" Skykit almost yelling.

"I can."  Honeykit offered.

"Alright" Skykit told Honeykit while she passed to the medecine den to get the moss. 

Skykit cam back with mos and gave it to Honeykit. Honeykit threw the moss very hard and Skykit almost caught it.

"Ow..." Skykit waid as the moss hit her face.

"What? Did I throw the moss too hard??" Asked Honeykit

"Yes.." Replied Skykit.

Skykit was really done after that.

"What did you say?" Asked Honeykit.

"Whatever. I'm done playing." Skykit told Honeykit when she past her.

"Okay I'm going to continue." Honeykit said.

Ugh, why does Honeykit HAVE to be deaf? Skykit thought very upset while she padded to the nursery. 

"Mom, why is Honeykit deaf?" She asked.

"It is how she was born." Berrysky answerd.

"Hey guys." Honeykit said when she came in.

"Hello Honeykit, I have good news for both of you."

"What?" Skykit asked exitedly. "Is it what I think it is??"

"Probably." Honeykit replied exitedly "Is it what I think it is too?"

"I think you two might be right. You are both bec-" Berrysky got cut of

"WE ARE BECOMING??" Skykit and Honeykit asked exitedly.

"You are both becoming apprentices tomorrow." Berrysky finished.

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" Skykit and Honeykit screamed

## Chapter two (Honeypaw)

The day after they got the news there was a clan meeting. 

"Let all cats old enough to lurk in the shadows gather around the shade rock for a clan meeting!" Called Nightstar

Honeykit sat next to Skykit and Berrysky sat next to Skykit and Puddleclaw sat next to Honeykit

"Two kits have reached the age of Apprenticeship. Skykit please step forward." Skykit left Honeykit and stepped forward. "Skykit, you have reached the age of six moons, and it is time for you to be apprenticed. From this day on, until you receive your warrior name, you will be known as Skypaw. Your mentor will be Dustcloud." Nightstar finished.

"SKYPAW, SKYPAW" Everyone in camp chanted.

"Who is Skypaw?" Asked Honeykit

"Your sister, you will next be Honeypaw!" Answered Berrysky

"Honeykit, please step forward" Nightstar called to Honeykit.

Honeykit stepped forward.

"Honeykit, you have reached the age of six moons, and it is time for you to be apprenticed. From this day on, until you receive your warrior name, you will be known as Honeypaw. Your mentor will be Duskflight." Nightstar finished.

"HONEYPAW, HONEYPAW" Everyone in camp chanted.

Honeypaw padded to Duskflight and touched noses with her and Skypaw did the same with Dustcloud.

"Clan dismissed." Nightstar said to the clan.

"Do you want to go explore the territory?" Duskflight asked.

"Yes!" Honeypaw exlmaied.

"I can go see if we can do it with Skypaw." Duskflight added.

## Chapter 3 (Skypaw)

Duskflight padded up to Dustcloud and asked him something Skypaw couln't hear.

"No. I was thinking we would start at the Thunderclan boarder. Not the Riverclan boarder." Dustcloud replied to Duskflight.

"Oh.. alright." Duskflight said sadly padding twards Honeypaw.

"What did he say??" Honeypaw asked.

"He said no." Duskflight said in Honeypaw's ear.

"Oh... okay..." Honeypaw reacted.

"Come on Skypaw lets go look around the territory starting with the Thunderclan boarder." Dustcloud told Skypaw.
