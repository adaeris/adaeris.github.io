Section about: Project Sekai: Colorful Stage!


I play this game a lot. And when I say a lot, I mean multiple times everyday. 
So what I'm up to, opinions, as well as user IDs for both accounts I have will be on this page


What I'm currently up to:

Main account: Saving for the "On the Stage of Dazzling Light" Tsukasa card (almost 15k :D)

Alternate account: Nothing really


Notable Opinions

Group Ranks (in my opinion)
1. Nightcord at 25:00 / Wonderlands x Showtime
2. Vivid Bad Squad
3. More More Jump!
4. Leo/Need

I will have a page for each group and my opinions on them in the future.
